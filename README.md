# Go Data Structures

This repository provides implementations of commonly used data structures in Go. Each data structure includes examples and tests to help you understand and use them effectively.

## Data Structures Included

1. **Arrays**  
   - Basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

2. **Linked Lists**  
   - Singly and doubly linked lists with operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

3. **Stacks**  
   - LIFO implementation using slices and linked lists.

4. **Queues**  
   - FIFO implementation, including circular queues and priority queues.

5. **Trees**  
   - Binary trees, binary search trees, and tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order).

6. **Graphs**  
   - Adjacency list and matrix representations, BFS, DFS algorithms.

7. **Hash Maps**  
   - Implementation of basic hash maps with collision handling.

8. **Heaps**  
   - Min-heap and max-heap with insertion and deletion operations.
